Throughout this project, I'll ultilize the P-A-C-E framework to solve this problem.

                                  **_PLAN_**

- **Business Background**: 

Yellow Cabs Taxi Co. is a mid-sized urban transportation company serving thousands of passengers daily. Over the past year, the company has faced declining ride demand, rising operational costs, and increased customer complaints. Fuel prices fluctuate, driver availability is inconsistent, and customer wait times have grown longer. Despite having access to large amounts of trip and operational data, the company has not been using analytics to guide decisions. 

To address these challenges, the CEO hired me as a data analyst to uncover insights, optimize operations, and identify opportunities to improve efficiency, profitability, and customer satisfaction.


- **Here is the list of five questions the business owner would like to know:**
1. What drives our ride demand throughout the day, week, and month?
2. Are increasing passenger wait times caused by a shortage of available drivers?
3. How much do rising fuel prices affect our overall profit?
4. What factors influence customer ratings, and how can we improve them?
5. Can we predict which rides are likely to result in a customer complaint?
